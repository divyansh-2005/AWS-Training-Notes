## AWS Backup
AWS Backup is a fully managed service that simplifies and centralizes data protection across AWS services and hybrid workloads. It allows you to automate backup processes, create backup policies, and manage lifecycle and compliance for your data. Some key features include:

- **Policy-Based Backup**: Define backup requirements like frequency and retention periods.
- **Cross-Region and Cross-Account Backup**: Enhance disaster recovery and business continuity.
- **Ransomware Protection**: Create immutable backups and logically air-gapped vaults.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Audit and report on data protection policies using real-time analytics.
